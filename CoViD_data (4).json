Clean hands can stop germs from spreading from one person to another and throughout an entire community—from your home and workplace to childcare facilities and hospitals. \n \nFollow these five steps every time. \n \n-Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap. \n-Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails. \n-Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the “Happy Birthday” song from beginning to end twice. \n-Rinse your hands well under clean, running water. \n-Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry them.\",\n        \"Source\": \"https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html\",\n        \"Reference\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IisgnbMfKvI\",\n        \"Image_URL\": \"https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnfull/20161013/428691\",\n        \"Response_Type\": \"Card\",\n        \"Audio_Link\": null,\n        \"Suggestions\": \"['How to get rid of viruses on my phone']\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Intent\": \"how-to-do-precautionary-action\",\n        \"Entities\": \"{'precautionary_actions': 'put a mask'}\",\n        \"Sample_Question\": \"How do I wear a mask\",\n        \"Answer_Title\": \"Wearning Mask\",\n        \"Answer\": \"-Before putting on a mask, clean hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.\n-Cover mouth and nose with mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask.\n-Avoid touching the mask while using it; if you do, clean your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.\n-Replace the mask with a new one as soon as it is damp and do not reuse single-use masks.\",\n        \"Source\": \"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks\",\n        \"Reference\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrvFrH_npQI&feature=emb_logo\",\n        \"Image_URL\": \"https://i.insider.com/5e583363fee23d3fd10eac33?width=1100&format=jpeg&auto=webp\",\n        \"Response_Type\": \"Card\",\n        \"Audio_Link\": null,\n        \"Suggestions\": \"['How to wear gloves?', 'What is the right way of removing my mask']\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Intent\": \"how-to-do-precautionary-action\",\n        \"Entities\": \"{'precautionary_actions': 'dispose a mask'}\",\n        \"Sample_Question\": \"Can you show me the correct way of disposing a mask ?\",\n        \"Answer_Title\": \"Disposing Mask\",\n        \"Answer\": \"One should always wash their hands before taking off the mask, as touching one’s face with unwashed hands heightens the risk of illnesses.\nAfter that, one should take off the mask, and fold it in half inwards, such that the droplets from the mouth and nose are not exposed.

Open the inner packaging as directed. Do not touch anything inside of the package. Step 1 in the picture shows how the gloves look in the package.\n-Wash your hands with soap and water. Dry them well. See “Do you know… Clean hands.”\n-Using your non-dominant hand (the one you do not write with), pick up the glove for your other hand by the cuff. Step 2 in the picture shows how this looks.This glov is for your dominant hand (the one you write with). Be careful to touch just the inside of the cuff and glove. This part will touch your skin when the glove is on your hand.\n-Let the glove hang with the fingers pointing downward. Then slide your dominant hand into the glove with your palm facing up and your fingers open. Step 3 in the picture shows how this looks. Be careful not to touch the package as you put on the gloves.\n-If the glove does not go on straight, wait to adjust it until you put on the other glove. Keep your hands above your waist to make sure they stay sterile.\n-Use the hand with the glove to slide your fingers under the cuff of the second glove. Step 4 in the picture shows how this looks. Only touch the outside of this glove. This part will not be against your skin when the glove is on your hand.\n-Let the glove hang with the fingers pointing downward. Slide your hand into the glove with the palm up and the fingers open. Step 5 in the picture shows how this looks.\n-Adjust both gloves until they fit properly. Only touch sterile gloved areas.\",\n        \"Source\": \"https://www.stjude.org/treatment/patient-resources/caregiver-resources/patient-family-education-sheets/tracheostomy-care/how-to-put-on-sterile-gloves.html\",\n        \"Reference\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl7u3kJHYHY\",\n        \"Image_URL\": \"https://www.stjude.org/content/sites/www/en_US/home/treatment/patient-resources/caregiver-resources/patient-family-education-sheets/tracheostomy-care/how-to-put-on-sterile-gloves/jcr:content/par-1/cnt_embedcolumn/par-1/cnt_image.img.1000.high.jpg/1494341345427.jpg\",\n        \"Response_Type\": \"Card\",\n        \"Audio_Link\": null,\n        \"Suggestions\": \"['How to remove gloves', 'How to wear mask?']\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Intent\": \"how-to-do-precautionary-action\",\n        \"Entities\": \"{'precautionary_actions': 'removing a glove'}\",\n        \"Sample_Question\": \"How do I remove my gloves?\",\n        \"Answer_Title\": \"Removing Gloves\",\n        \"Answer\": \"Pinch and hold the outside of the glove near the wrist area.\nPeel downwards, away from the wrist, turning the glove inside out.\nPull the glove away until it is removed from the hand and hold the inside-out glove with the gloved hand.\nWith your un-gloved hand, slide your finger/s under the wrist of the remaining glove, taking care not to touch the outside of the glove.\nAgain, peel downwards, away from the wrist, turning the glove inside out.\nContinue to pull the glove down and over the inside-out glove being held in your gloved hand.\nThis will ensure that both gloves are inside out, one glove enveloped inside the other, with no contaminant on the bare hands.\",\n        \"Source\": \"https://www.globus.co.uk/how-to-safely-remove-disposable-gloves\",\n        \"Reference\": \"https://youtu.be/3I_kKVNrEMo\",\n        \"Image_URL\": \"https://www.globus.co.uk/img/disposable-glove-donning.jpg\",\n        \"Response_Type\": \"Card\",\n        \"Audio_Link\": null,\n        \"Suggestions\": \"['How to wear gloves?', 'How to wear mask?']\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Intent\": \"how-to-do-precautionary-action\",\n        \"Entities\": \"{'precautionary_actions': 'disposing a glove'}\",\n        \"Sample_Question\": \"What is the correct way of disposing of gloves?\",\n        \"Answer_Title\": \"Disposing Gloves\",\n        \"Answer\": \"Pinch and hold the outside of the glove near the wrist area.\nPeel downwards, away from the wrist, turning the glove inside out.\nPull the glove away until it is removed from the hand and hold the inside-out glove with the gloved hand.\nWith your un-gloved hand, slide your finger/s under the wrist of the remaining glove, taking care not to touch the outside of the glove.\nAgain, peel downwards, away from the wrist, turning the glove inside out.\nContinue to pull the glove down and over the inside-out glove being held in your gloved hand.\nThis will ensure that both gloves are inside out, one glove enveloped inside the other, with no contaminant on the bare hands.\",\n        \"Source\": \"https://www.globus.co.uk/how-to-safely-remove-disposable-gloves\",\n        \"Reference\": \"https://youtu.be/3I_kKVNrEMo\",\n        \"Image_URL\": \"https://www.globus.co.uk/img/disposable-glove-donning.jpg\",\n        \"Response_Type\": \"Card\",\n        \"Audio_Link\": null,\n        \"Suggestions\": \"['How to wear gloves?']\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Intent\": \"how-to-do-precautionary-action\",\n        \"Entities\": \"{'precautionary_actions': 'stay calm'}\",\n        \"Sample_Question\": \"How do I stay calm?\",\n        \"Answer_Title\": \"Staying Calm\",\n        \"Answer\": \"Regular meditation is very calming.

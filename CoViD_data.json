But if that’s not an option, it’s perfectly acceptable to express your concerns to your supervisor or HR team. You could simply say, “I know John is working hard, but it seems like he’s not feeling very well. Is it possible to ask him to work from home until he’s no longer running a fever or coughing? I’m concerned about him infecting others in the office.”These can feel like awkward conversations to have. But it’s the job of leadership and HR teams to provide a safe work environment to all employees—and they’re trained to address thorny issues like these.",

Most often a clinician takes a swab of your nose (or both your nose and throat). The sample is delivered to labs that have been approved to perform the test. The number of tests and testing sites available are rapidly increasing. Still, it will take weeks before the test is available to everyone who may be infected. Meanwhile, clinicians will primarily test those with respiratory symptoms who have recently traveled to certain countries, live in a community with many infected people, or likely have been exposed to someone known to have COVID-19. Call the State Helpline Number or Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India"s 24x7 helpline 011-2397 8046. If one qualifies as a case for testing as per the protocol, they would be tested at a Government approved lab only.",

        "Answer": "There is a strong evidence that it can be transmitted by people who are just mildly ill or even presymptomatic. That means COVID-19 will be much harder to contain than the Middle East respiratory syndrome or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which were spread much less efficiently and only by symptomatic people",

Most often a clinician takes a swab of your nose (or both your nose and throat). The sample is delivered to labs that have been approved to perform the test. The number of tests and testing sites available are rapidly increasing. Still, it will take weeks before the test is available to everyone who may be infected. Meanwhile, clinicians will primarily test those with respiratory symptoms who have recently traveled to certain countries, live in a community with many infected people, or likely have been exposed to someone known to have COVID-19. Call the State Helpline Number or Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India"s 24x7 helpline 011-2397 8046. If one qualifies as a case for testing as per the protocol, they would be tested at a Government approved lab only.",

A study last year found infectious germs on about a third of the surfaces at 16 different fitness facilities. Exercise boosts our immune systems, and even a single workout can improve our ability to fight off germs, according to the latest research. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.",

Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails. -Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer?

        "Answer_Title": "Wearning Gloves",
        "Answer": "-Remove the outer packaging of the sterile gloves. Open the inner packaging as directed. Do not touch anything inside of the package. Step 1 in the picture shows how the gloves look in the package.-Wash your hands with soap and water. Dry them well. See “Do you know… Clean hands.”-Using your non-dominant hand (the one you do not write with), pick up the glove for your other hand by the cuff. Step 2 in the picture shows how this looks.This glov is for your dominant hand (the one you write with). Be careful to touch just the inside of the cuff and glove. This part will touch your skin when the glove is on your hand.-Let the glove hang with the fingers pointing downward. Then slide your dominant hand into the glove with your palm facing up and your fingers open. Step 3 in the picture shows how this looks. Be careful not to touch the package as you put on the gloves.-If the glove does not go on straight, wait to adjust it until you put on the other glove. Keep your hands above your waist to make sure they stay sterile.-Use the hand with the glove to slide your fingers under the cuff of the second glove. Step 4 in the picture shows how this looks. Only touch the outside of this glove. This part will not be against your skin when the glove is on your hand.-Let the glove hang with the fingers pointing downward. Slide your hand into the glove with the palm up and the fingers open. Step 5 in the picture shows how this looks.-Adjust both gloves until they fit properly. Only touch sterile gloved areas.",

        "Answer_Title": "Staying Calm",
        "Answer": "Regular meditation is very calming. Many apps teach simple forms of meditation, such as Headspace or Calm. Not a yoga person? No need to start now unless you"d like to try it. Sometimes trying new things and discovering new activities you can benefit from and enjoy can be a welcome, healthy distraction. Yoga Studio and Pocket Yoga are good apps to consider.",
